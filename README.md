## Description

**Open Beats**, is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) that aims to allow artists to collaborate with others on music synchronously and remotely. The project is currently beginning development for [Jesse Hartloff's CSE 442 class](https://cse442.com/) for the Fall 2021 semester at the University at Buffalo, as well as []() for the Fall 2021 semester at the University at Buffalo.

This repository contains the code for a social media application that bundles with Open Beats. The goal is to allow musical artists who have produced songs on Open Beats to upload, listen and share their songs with others, as well as stream music from various streaming services.
